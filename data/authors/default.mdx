A serial entrepreneur co-founding 5 startups with 2 successful exits, passionate about helping startups from zero to one in AI product development.

I am a results-driven tech entrepreneur with a solid foundation in Software Engineering, complemented by an MBA specializing in entrepreneurship. My academic journey led me to a Master's in Artificial Intelligence, where I achieved groundbreaking results in speech recognition systems for the Persian language, with unprecedented accuracy rates of above 92%.

As a co-founder of Inteliver, I successfully developed an AI-driven Image Management as a Service platform, leading to its acquisition by a prominent Singaporean company. With expertise in software development, team management, and AI algorithms, I am dedicated to creating innovative and disruptive startups that redefine industry standards.
