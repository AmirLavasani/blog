Automatic speech recognition has made remarkable strides in recent years, thanks to advances in deep learning and the abundance of speech data. However, most speech recognition systems are still designed for major languages like English, while less prevalent languages are often overlooked. In my master‚Äôs thesis, I sought to develop a speech recognition system tailored specifically for the Persian language by leveraging deep neural networks.

# The Significance of Persian Speech Recognition
The ability to automatically transcribe speech into text can immensely enhance how we interact with devices and systems. Yet Persian speakers have largely lacked access to robust speech interfaces due to limited progress on Persian speech recognition. My goal was to help bridge this gap by designing a system capable of recognizing conversational and continuous Persian speech.

Beyond facilitating voice-based interactions, my hope is that the research will encourage more efforts on underserved languages and make speech recognition accessible to millions of Persian speakers worldwide.

# Constructing the FarsAva Persian Speech Dataset
A fundamental requirement for training speech recognition systems is extensive audio data in the target language. Unfortunately, publicly available Persian speech data has been scarce and insufficient.

To overcome this limitation, I undertook the ambitious task of compiling the FarsAva speech corpus. Meticulously gathered from diverse sources, this dataset encompasses over 5000 hours of Persian speech data from more than 6000 speakers. The diversity in topics, accents, environments, and conversational styles empowers this dataset to capture the breadth of variations in spoken Persian.

The development of FarsAva dataset has been a major contribution of my thesis, providing a valuable resource for future research on Persian speech processing.

# Deep Neural Networks for Phonetic Modeling
The core of any speech recognition system is the acoustic model, responsible for recognizing phonetic sounds based on the input audio. I explored various neural network architectures for this phonetic modeling task.
Specifically, I implemented and evaluated three models:

1. Gaussian Mixture Model - Hidden Markov Model (GMM/HMM)
2. Deep Belief Network - Hidden Markov Model (DBN/HMM)
3. Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (RNN/LSTM)

The GMM/HMM system acts as a baseline to compare improvements. The DBN/HMM employs deep belief networks for feature learning. Finally, the RNN/LSTM utilizes recurrent networks to capture temporal speech patterns.

# Findings: RNNs Yield Substantial Improvements
When tested on diverse Persian speech data, the deep neural network models demonstrated significant gains over the GMM/HMM baseline. Specifically, the RNN/LSTM model reduced the Word Error Rate (WER) by over 25% relative improvement across testing datasets.

The volume of training data also exerted a notable impact. The RNN/LSTM model leveraged the abundance of data in FarsAva to continue improving accuracy, while the GMM and DBN models plateaued after hundreds of hours.

Overall, the results highlighted the capabilities of deep neural networks for advancing speech recognition in Persian. The RNN/LSTM model achieved the lowest error rates, proving particularly adept at handling the nuances of the Persian language.

# Persian Language Modeling
In addition to the acoustic model, I developed a Persian language model to estimate word sequences in the decoded speech output. After compiling a large Persian text corpus, I trained and evaluated N-gram language models with diverse smoothing techniques.

The language model supplemented the acoustic model by applying Persian linguistic patterns to reconstruct probable word strings. Integrating the language model significantly boosted the speech recognition accuracy compared to solely relying on acoustics.

# Conclusion
This pioneering research endeavored to push the frontiers of speech technology for the Persian language. While plenty of opportunities remain for advancement, I hope these foundations spur further innovations in this domain.

The capacity of deep learning models to capture linguistic nuances was convincingly demonstrated. But ultimately, language accessibility should remain the guiding light driving research - to create intelligent systems that understand and empower people regardless of background.
